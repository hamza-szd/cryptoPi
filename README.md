# SE101-CryptoPi
First year Software Engineering project

In recent years, advances in Blockchain technology have resulted in exciting applications such as novel digital asset classes, smart contracts and more.

The purpose of this idea is to make it easier for people to enjoy the benefits of digital currencies – anonymity, privacy, decentralization, while also being easily able to send and receive money. We believe that participating in the cryptoeconomy is a catalyst for freedom and economic progress and wish to make it as convenient as possible.

We wanted CryptoPi to be as convenient and easy to use as possible, which is why we decided on a physical wallet that would allow for two users to initiate a transaction with just a tap between the two devices. To achieve this, the wallet utilizes a NFC hat capable of reading MIFARE NFC tags containing relevant wallet and transaction data. To further bring convienience, we created an accessible graphical user interface that allows the user to view and manage their cryptocurrency holdings from a web browser, or mobile companion app. 

As a sensitive financial related platform, we also want to ensure that our product has the highest level of security possible. This is why we implemented facial recognition, using OpenCV and Azure's Facial Recognition API to authenticate transactions, to ensure that users are in control of their cryptocurrency
